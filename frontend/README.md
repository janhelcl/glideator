# Glideator Frontend

## Overview

This project contains the frontend web application for the Glideator project. It provides a user interface likely used for visualizing gliding data, potentially involving maps and various data plots. It is bootstrapped using Create React App.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   **UI Library:** [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)
*   **Routing:** [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
*   **State Management:** (Implicitly React Context API or component state, consider adding a dedicated library if complexity grows)
*   **HTTP Client:** [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
*   **Mapping:** [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
*   **Plotting:** [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) with [react-plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
*   **Date Handling:** [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)
*   **Utilities:** [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
*   **Build Tool:** [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (using `react-scripts`)
*   **Package Manager:** [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18 or later recommended, as per `Dockerfile.dev`)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd glideator/frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically when you make edits. Lint errors will also be visible in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
*   `npm run eject`: **(Use with caution!)** Removes the single build dependency and copies configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control. This is a one-way operation.

## Project Structure

The frontend codebase is organized as follows:

```

├── public/           # Static assets and index.html template
├── src/              # Main application source code
│   ├── components/   # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/        # Top-level page components (routed views)

│   └── ...           # Other configuration/setup files (tests, web vitals)
├── build/            # Production build output (generated by `npm run build`)
├── node_modules/     # Project dependencies (managed by npm)
├── .dockerignore     # Specifies files/dirs to ignore in Docker builds
├── Dockerfile.dev    # Docker configuration for development environment
├── package.json      # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json # Exact dependency versions
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles React in production mode and outputs the static files to the `build/` directory. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for caching purposes. These files are ready for deployment to a static file server or hosting platform.

## Docker

A `Dockerfile.dev` is included to facilitate setting up a containerized development environment. It uses Node.js 18, installs dependencies, and sets up the application to run on port 3000. This can be used with tools like Docker Compose for a consistent development setup.
