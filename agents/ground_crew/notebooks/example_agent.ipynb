      "1. Visit the website and thoroughly search the website for a link to a meteostation.\n",
      "  - Some of the websites are pretty messy with suboptimal navigation.\n",
      "  - Search for hidden menus in the header or footer.\n",
      "  - Use screenshot tool to confirm you found the meteostation and that it is active.\n",
      "  - You are allowed to click on links to other domains if the source website links directly to them, but you MUST stay only on the URL that is directly linked from the source website. Do NOT browse further or navigate within the new domain.\n",
      "2. Provide the full URL of the meteostation. \n",
      "  - If the meteostation is embedded in an iframe, DO NOT extract the iframe URL. Provide the URL the meteostation is embedded in.\n",
      "  - There may be multiple meteostations on the URL, that is fine.\n",
