# Parra-Glideator – Your AI-powered Paragliding Companion

Parra-Glideator is an innovative web application designed to help paraglider pilots find the perfect place and time to fly. Leveraging sophisticated machine learning and generative AI models, it recommends the best flying spots based on weather forecasts and historical flight conditions.

Meet **Parra-Glideator**, our charming, paragliding gladiator parrot who traded natural flight for a paraglider. Like him, every pilot faces uncertainty—weather conditions, location choice, or flight planning can become a daunting battle. Parra-Glideator is here to ensure you have the odds on your side.

🌤️ **Fly smarter, safer, and with more confidence!**

The project is currently in **public beta** and available at [parra-glideator.com](https://www.parra-glideator.com/). Try it out, plan your next flight adventure, and help us refine this pilot-friendly tool!

## Model Training Pipeline

1. Scrapers write raw flights & sites → Postgres.
2. `dbt` transforms them into clean mart tables.
3. Training notebooks export WebDataset shards.
4. PyTorch models are trained & the best checkpoint is shipped to the API.
