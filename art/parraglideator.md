# Parra-Glideator: The Mascot of Glideator

## 🦜 Core Concept

Parra-Glideator is a colorful, cheeky **parrot** who thinks he's a **gladiator** — but instead of flying like a normal bird, he paraglides. He’s kitted out with a **tiny Roman helmet**, a feather-plumed harness, and the bravado of a true sky warrior. Nobody knows why he doesn’t fly the natural way — and he won’t talk about it. It’s a mystery.

## 🎭 Personality

### 🗣️ Speech Style
- A mix of epic Roman-style speech and modern pilot lingo
- Sample lines:
  - “*By the gods of the sky, I shall thermal forth!*”
  - “*Caution! A dragon of rotor lurks yonder ridge!*”
  - “*I came, I saw… I bombed out.*”

### 😂 Vibe
- Cocky but lovable
- Dramatic flair, but often ends up tangled or flustered
- Tries to be noble, but is constantly getting into silly situations

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Mystery: Why Doesn’t He Fly?

### The Big Question
**Why would a bird paraglide?**

Nobody knows. Ask him directly, and he’ll dodge:
> “I have *chosen* the noble path of man-borne flight, for wings alone cannot lift one’s soul!”

But sometimes, when he’s watching vultures or stares at a distant cloud, he mutters:
> “I used to fly like that… once.”

### Possible Lore
- Born in the **Canopy Coliseum**, raised in the clouds
- Lost his natural flight in the mysterious “**Great Flap Incident**”
- Some say he flew too high and saw something no parrot should see
- Now he flies *with gear*, maybe by choice… maybe not

## 🔮 Easter Egg Ideas

- **Comic strip**: A bird asks “Why not just fly?” He pauses, the sky darkens… then yells “BECAUSE THIS IS MORE EPIC!” and flies away.
- **404 Page**: “I once tried to go there… never again.”
- **Hidden murals**: Shadowy image of a broken feather and crashed wing, never explained
- **Clues across site**: Breadcrumbs that hint at his past
